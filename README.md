Project 


It has always been hard to maintain and satisfy all patients in their treatment journey due to the crowding and increased requests for doctors, ICUs, medications, and ambulances.

For that, we did our best to make it easy for you as a service provider to maintain an enormous amount of people and make the job gets done easily.

By connecting the patient directly with the desierd organization it will save you from critical problems like long ques and wasting much of your time by organizing them and hiring staff for doing that.
You can run the code through VSCode by hitting run without debugging on the top bar.
The project is still ongoing and not completed, this is a part of the first platform out of 2 others.
